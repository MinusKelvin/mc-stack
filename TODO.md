# TODO

* Add something like Lua's metatables for greater control over table types
* Implement an assembler
* Implement a standard library
* Lots and lost of testing
  - "Long yields"
  - Multiple coroutines
* Add stack size checking
* Add stack traceback
* Implement a basic concatinative language that compiles to assembly
* Write VM documentation and specification (right now implementation acts as both :scream: )
